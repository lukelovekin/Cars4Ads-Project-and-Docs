## The Application and its Purpose

Cars4Ads is a webpage designed to connect business owners, great and small, with car owners willing to rent some of their external car space for some extra cash.
Car owners can post ads with attractive details like showing their location, their usual driving routes, how far they drive on average, pictures of their car space with a description of the area of the car that they're happy to use as rent space. Otherwise business owners can also post ads on the webpage showing their advertisement plans for a car, an image, size of the ad, its preferable location i.e the rear window or side doors, prefered area for the ad to be active

There is currently a webpage/business that allows the business owner or the car owner to contact this business via an online application of which then the applicant must wait to be contacted by this website once they have found a candidate. The problem Cars4Ads aims to solve is by allowing the business owners and car owners to deal with each other directly, immediatly, more transparently while cutting out the unnecessarily highly profitable business in the middle. Also, by cutting out the middle man, the car owners and business owners will be able to negotiate on price or set a fixed price in their ads so either of the two can potentially expect to save or make more on the their advertising costs and car rental profits. This problem needs to be solved to help the smaller businesses get into marketing their business more cost effectively and allows them to have more control of where their advertisements get placed and who to, as well as potentially leaving more money in the pockets of both the business and car owner. 

Target audience for Cars4Ads will be, for the car owner users side of the webpage, anybody aged 17 to max driving age looking to make a bit of extra pocket money for going about their day as they would normally. Otherwise any age at all, for anyone looking to advertise their business or product in an easy, low cost way.
